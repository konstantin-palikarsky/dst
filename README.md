Please find details about the template in the assignment document.

Build
-----

Each Maven module has a corresponding profile that contains the build config for the respective module.
For example, to build the JPA task of assignment 1, run

    mvn clean install -Pass1-jpa

You can add the `-DskipTests` flag to skip JUnit test execution.

There is also a profile `all`, that includes all modules.
You should activate this profile in your IDE's Maven ([IDEA],[Eclipse]) configuration!

NB!!! Due to developing on Windows I have connected my client to Docker via an address, this won't work unless TLS is 
disabled and in general should not be necessary to run the ContainerService on a different machine
